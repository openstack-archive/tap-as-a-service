    [`blueprint port-mirroring-sriov-vf <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/port-mirroring-sriov-vf>`_]
    * Adds a new TaaS Agent driver (i.e. SRIOV) for Intel i40e driver backend.
    * Neutron TaaS Agent is refactored to decouple its tight binding with ovs
      driver. This prepares the taas agent code-base for addition of a new
      TaaS Agent driver (SRIOV).
    * Adds a new API extension, i.e. taas-vlan-filter for adding a new
      attribute (vlan_filter) in tap-flow data model.
