We want to have separate compressed css files for horizon.scss and dashboard.scss.
The reason for it is based on the fact that IE9 has a limit on the number of css rules
that can be parsed in a single css file.  The limit is 4095 = (4k - 1). This causes some
css rules getting cut off if one css file to get more than 4k rules inside.
